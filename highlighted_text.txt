<kw>Google</kw> is <kw>acquiring</kw> <kw>data</kw> <kw>science</kw> <kw>community</kw> <kw>Kaggle</kw>. Sources tell us that <kw>Google</kw> is <kw>acquiring</kw> <kw>Kaggle</kw>, a <kw>platform</kw> that hosts <kw>data</kw> <kw>science</kw> and <kw>machine</kw> <kw>learning</kw> <kw>competitions</kw>. Details about the transaction remain somewhat vague, but given that <kw>Google</kw> is hosting its <kw>Cloud</kw> Next conference in <kw>San</kw> <kw>Francisco</kw> this week, the official announcement could come as <kw>early</kw> as tomorrow. Reached by phone, <kw>Kaggle</kw> co-founder CEO Anthony <kw>Goldbloom</kw> <kw>declined</kw> to deny that the <kw>acquisition</kw> is happening. <kw>Google</kw> itself <kw>declined</kw> 'to comment on rumors'. <kw>Kaggle</kw>, which has about half a million <kw>data</kw> <kw>scientists</kw> on its <kw>platform</kw>, was founded by <kw>Goldbloom</kw> and Ben Hamner in 2010. The <kw>service</kw> got an <kw>early</kw> start and even though it has a few competitors like DrivenData, TopCoder and HackerRank, it has managed to stay well ahead of them by focusing on its specific niche. The <kw>service</kw> is basically the de facto home for running <kw>data</kw> <kw>science</kw>  and <kw>machine</kw> <kw>learning</kw> <kw>competitions</kw>. With <kw>Kaggle</kw>, <kw>Google</kw> is buying one of the largest and most active communities for <kw>data</kw> <kw>scientists</kw> - and with that, it will get increased mindshare in this <kw>community</kw>, too (though it already has plenty of that thanks to Tensorflow and other projects). <kw>Kaggle</kw> has a bit of a history with <kw>Google</kw>, too, but that's pretty recent. Earlier this month, <kw>Google</kw> and <kw>Kaggle</kw> teamed up to host a $100,000 <kw>machine</kw> <kw>learning</kw> <kw>competition</kw> around classifying YouTube videos. That <kw>competition</kw> had some deep integrations with the <kw>Google</kw> <kw>Cloud</kw> <kw>Platform</kw>, too. Our understanding is that <kw>Google</kw> will keep the <kw>service</kw> running - likely under its current name. While the <kw>acquisition</kw> is probably more about Kaggle's <kw>community</kw> than technology, <kw>Kaggle</kw> did build some interesting tools for hosting its <kw>competition</kw> and 'kernels', too. On <kw>Kaggle</kw>, kernels are basically the source code for analyzing <kw>data</kw> sets and developers can share this code on the <kw>platform</kw> (the company previously called them 'scripts'). Like similar competition-centric sites, <kw>Kaggle</kw> also runs a job board, too. It's unclear what <kw>Google</kw> will do with that part of the <kw>service</kw>. According to Crunchbase, <kw>Kaggle</kw> raised $12.5 million (though PitchBook says it's $12.75) since its launch in 2010. Investors in <kw>Kaggle</kw> include Index <kw>Ventures</kw>, SV Angel, Max Levchin, Naval Ravikant, <kw>Google</kw> chief economist Hal Varian, Khosla <kw>Ventures</kw> and Yuri Milner
