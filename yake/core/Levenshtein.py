"""
Module providing optimized Levenshtein distance and ratio calculations.

This module implements an optimized version of the Levenshtein (edit distance) 
algorithm for measuring the difference between two strings. It provides both 
a raw distance calculation and a normalized similarity ratio, which are useful 
for comparing text strings and identifying potential matches with slight variations.

Optimizations include:
- Memory-efficient two-row approach instead of full matrix
- Early termination for highly dissimilar strings
- LRU caching for repeated calculations
- Optimized algorithms for short strings

class Levenshtein:
    """
    Optimized class for computing Levenshtein distance and similarity ratio.

    This class provides static methods to calculate the edit distance between
    strings (how many insertions, deletions, or substitutions are needed to
    transform one string into another) and to determine a normalized similarity
    ratio between them, with significant performance optimizations.

    These metrics are widely used in fuzzy string matching, spell checking,
    and approximate text similarity measurements.
